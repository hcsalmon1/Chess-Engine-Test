  bitwise operations:
  | - OR - will set a bit to 1 if either bit in two integers is 1
  & - AND - will set a bit to 1 if both bits in two integers is 1
  ~ - NOT - will invert all bits to the opposite
  >> - SHIFT RIGHT - will move all bits to the right. Right means a lower value.
  << - SHIFT LEFT - will move all bits to the left. Left means a higher value.
  ^ - XOR - If only one bit is set in two integers, the bit is set. If both are set in two integers, it is 0.

__Adding and removing bits__

All pieces are represented by an unsigned 64 bit integer.

  unsigned long long bitboard_array[12];
  const int WP = 0, WN = 1, WB = 2, WR = 3, WQ = 4, WK = 5, BP = 6, BN = 7, BB = 8, BR = 9, BQ = 10, BK = 11;

You can add a bit to a bitboard using a bitwise or: |

  unsigned long long bitboard = 0;
  bitboard |= 1ULL << 50; //places 1 bit in square 50, c2

The bitshift operator will move all bits by that amount. 1 shifted by 50 simply puts one bit in "square" 50.
To avoid bitshifting I mostly use the SQUARE_BBS array. This simply indexes all of those values in a constant.
So instead we write:

  unsigned long long bitboard = 0;
  bitboard |= SQUARE_BBS[50]; //places 1 bit in square 50, c2

These are the same. To make this a bit more human I also made square constants:

  const int A8 = 0, B8 = 1, C8 = 2 etc.

To remove a bit we need to set that bit on a ulong and then invert the bits:

  unsigned long long bitboard = 0;
  bitboard |= SQUARE_BBS[50]; //places 1 bit in square 50, c2
  bitboard &= ~SQUARE_BBS[50]; //bitboard now = 0 again

  SQUARE_BBS[50] = 
  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
  0  0  1  0  0  0  0  0
  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0

  ~SQUARE_BBS[50] = 
  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1
  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1
  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1
  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1
  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1
  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1
  1  1  0  1  1  1  1  1
  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1

If you bitwise AND (&) with the inverted bitboard it will keep all bits the same
except the empty one.
Let's say we want to move a pawn:

  unsigned long long black_pawns = 65280;
  in bits = 
  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1
  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0

We need to remove the bit we want and place it somewhere else. Let's d7 to d5:

  black_pawns |= SQUARE_BBS[D5]; //add the bit
  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1
  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
  0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0
  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0

This puts a bit on d5. Now we remove d7 like so:

  black_pawns &= ~SQUARE_BBS[D7]; //remove the bit
  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
  1  1  1  1  0  1  1  1
  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
  0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0
  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0

That's how we move pieces.

__Generate moves__

__Occupancies__

We track white and black pieces together using occupancies. One approach is to make them global:

  unsigned long long occupancies[3];
  const int WHITE_OCCUPANCIES = 0, BLACK_OCCUPANCIES = 1, COMBINED_OCCUPANCIES = 2;

The fastest approach is to update the occupancies with every move. However this gave me the most headaches 
imaginable with debugging. For example Castling:

    case TAG_W_CASTLE_KS: //it's a castle move
      bitboard_array_global[WK] |= Constants.SQUARE_BBS[G1]; //move the white king to G1
      bitboard_array_global[WK] &= ~Constants.SQUARE_BBS[E1];
      bitboard_array_global[WR] |= Constants.SQUARE_BBS[F1]; //move the white rook to F1
      bitboard_array_global[WR] &= ~Constants.SQUARE_BBS[H1];
      //We do the same for the occupancies
      occupancies[WHITE_OCCUPANCIES] |= Constants.SQUARE_BBS[G1]; 
      occupancies[WHITE_OCCUPANCIES] &= ~Constants.SQUARE_BBS[E1];
      occupancies[WHITE_OCCUPANCIES] |= Constants.SQUARE_BBS[F1];
      occupancies[WHITE_OCCUPANCIES] &= ~Constants.SQUARE_BBS[H1];
      occupancies[COMBINED_OCCUPANCIES] |= Constants.SQUARE_BBS[G1];
      occupancies[COMBINED_OCCUPANCIES] &= ~Constants.SQUARE_BBS[E1];
      occupancies[COMBINED_OCCUPANCIES] |= Constants.SQUARE_BBS[F1];
      occupancies[COMBINED_OCCUPANCIES] &= ~Constants.SQUARE_BBS[H1];

      castle_rights_global[WKS_CASTLE_RIGHTS] = false;
      castle_rights_global[WQS_CASTLE_RIGHTS] = false;
      ep_global = NO_SQUARE;

The amount of bug potential this creates is crazy. The safest thing to do is bitwise OR 
the boards together for each position:

    const unsigned long long WHITE_OCCUPANCIES = bitboard_array[0] |
                                                 bitboard_array[1] |
                                                 bitboard_array[2] |
                                                 bitboard_array[3] |
                                                 bitboard_array[4] |
                                                 bitboard_array[5];

    const unsigned long long BLACK_OCCUPANCIES = bitboard_array[6] |
                                                 bitboard_array[7] |
                                                 bitboard_array[8] |
                                                 bitboard_array[9] |
                                                 bitboard_array[10] |
                                                 bitboard_array[11];

    const unsigned long long COMBINED_OCCUPANCIES = WHITE_OCCUPANCIES | BLACK_OCCUPANCIES;
    const unsigned long long EMPTY_OCCUPANCIES = ~COMBINED_OCCUPANCIES;

This simply joins the white and black pieces together respectively. We can then use the occupancies for moves.
To find white capture moves we bitwise AND the attacks with BLACK_OCCUPANCIES and viceversa for black occupancies.
To get regular moves we bitwise AND attacks with EMPTY_OCCUPANCIES.

__Pins and check__

First we need to work out pins and checks. The tutorial I followed didn't do this
and simply played each move and unmade the move if the king was attacked. This is 
a lot slower and I found an explanation online of how to work this out.

First we get the king position, let's say it's white to play:

  const int whiteKingPosition = BitscanForward(bitboard_array[BK]);

From the king square we need to use the piece moves to see if there is a check or pin:

  int whiteKingCheckCount = 0; //We track this for double check and castling

  //pawns
  tempBitboard = bitboard_array[BP] & WHITE_PAWN_ATTACKS[whiteKingPosition]; //Here we are checking if there is a pawn diagonal from the king

  if (tempBitboard != 0) //if it's not zero then there is a pawn
  {
    int pawnSquare = (DEBRUIJN64[MAGIC * (tempBitboard ^ (tempBitboard - 1)) >> 58]); //This inlines BitscanForward

    if (checkBitboard == 0) { //probably an unnecessary check
      checkBitboard = SQUARE_BBS[pawnSquare]; //We then set the checkbitboard with that square
    }
    whiteKingCheckCount++;
  }

For checks all we simply do is bitwise AND any potential moves with the checkbitboard. If there is no check then 
we set checkBitboard to a MAX_ULONG which simply means all bits are set.

  if (whiteKingCheckCount == 0) {
    checkBitboard = MAX_ULONG;
  }

This just avoids a conditional. So if there is a pawn attacking the white king then only moves that hit that square 
will be stored.

  tempBitboard = bitboard_array[WN]; 

  while (tempBitboard != 0) { //if there are still knights
      const int knightSquare = BitscanForward(tempBitboard);
      ulong knightAttacks = (KNIGHT_ATTACKS[knightSquare] & BLACK_OCCUPANCIES) & checkBitboard; 
      //if the knight attacks from this square intersect with a black piece.
      //If there is a piece attacking the king, does this move attack that piece?

      while (knightAttacks != 0) { 
          //save the move
      }
  }

For pins it's a bit more complicated. We first need INBETWEEN_BITBOARDS.
This is a multi dimensional array that simply has all of this bits inbetween every square combination.
It also includes the last square.
Example:

    INBETWEEN_BITBOARD[E1][E8] = 
    0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0
    0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0
    0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0
    0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0
    0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0
    0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0
    0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0
    0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0

    INBETWEEN_BITBOARD[B7][G2] = 
    0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
    0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
    0  0  1  0  0  0  0  0
    0  0  0  1  0  0  0  0
    0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0
    0  0  0  0  0  1  0  0
    0  0  0  0  0  0  1  0
    0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0

We use these for pins and check for rooks, queens and bishops.

      int pinArray[8][2] =
    {
        { -1, -1 },
        { -1, -1 },
        { -1, -1 },
        { -1, -1 },
        { -1, -1 },
        { -1, -1 },
        { -1, -1 },
        { -1, -1 },
    };

We create a pin array. The first index is the square being pinned. The second index is piece that is pinning the square.

        //bishops
        //From the white king, get the bishop moves but only including the black occupancies
        const unsigned long long bishopAttacksChecks = GetBishopAttacksFast(whiteKingPosition, BLACK_OCCUPANCIES_LOCAL); 

        temp_bitboard = bitboard_array_global[BB] & bishopAttacksChecks;  //See if there is a black bishop there
        while (temp_bitboard != 0) //if there is a black bishop there
        {
            const int piece_square = (DEBRUIJN64[MAGIC * (temp_bitboard ^ (temp_bitboard - 1)) >> 58]); //find the square
            temp_pin_bitboard = INBETWEEN_BITBOARDS[whiteKingPosition][piece_square] & WHITE_OCCUPANCIES_LOCAL;
            //for the squares inbetween, is there a white piece there

            if (temp_pin_bitboard == 0) //if there is no white piece, the bishop is attacking the king
            {
                if (check_bitboard == 0)
                {
                    check_bitboard = INBETWEEN_BITBOARDS[whiteKingPosition][piece_square]; //add the check
                }
                whiteKingCheckCount++;
            }
            else //if there is a white piece inbetween, there is a potential pin
            {
                const int pinned_square = (DEBRUIJN64[MAGIC * (temp_pin_bitboard ^ (temp_pin_bitboard - 1)) >> 58]); //get the square
                temp_pin_bitboard &= temp_pin_bitboard - 1; //remove one bit from bitboard

                if (temp_pin_bitboard == 0) //if the bitboard is not empty then that piece was pinned.
                {
                    pinArray[pinNumber][PINNED_SQUARE_INDEX] = pinned_square; //add the pinned square
                    pinArray[pinNumber][PINNING_PIECE_INDEX] = piece_square; //add the pinning piece
                    pinNumber++; //increase the pin number
                }
            }
            temp_bitboard &= temp_bitboard - 1; //remove the bit to stop infinitive loop
        }

We do the same for queen and rook.
We then check if a piece is pinned like so:

      temp_bitboard = bitboard_array_global[WN];

      while (temp_bitboard != 0)
      {
        starting_square = (DEBRUIJN64[MAGIC * (temp_bitboard ^ (temp_bitboard - 1)) >> 58]);
        temp_bitboard &= temp_bitboard - 1; //removes the knight from that square to not infinitely loop

        temp_pin_bitboard = MAX_ULONG; //set it max, so allows all moves first
        if (pinNumber != 0) //if there is a pin somewhere
        {
          for (int i = 0; i < pinNumber; i++) //loop through them
          {
            if (pinArray[i][PINNED_SQUARE_INDEX] == starting_square) //if this piece is pinned
            {
              temp_pin_bitboard = INBETWEEN_BITBOARDS[whiteKingPosition][pinArray[i][PINNING_PIECE_INDEX]]; 
              //set the temp_pin_bitboard to the bits in between the king and pinning piece
              //This means the knight can only move 
            }
          }
       }

        temp_attack = ((KNIGHT_ATTACKS[starting_square] & BLACK_OCCUPANCIES_LOCAL) & check_bitboard) & temp_pin_bitboard;
        //Then you AND the attacks with the check and pins

        //add moves if temp_attack isn't zero etc...
        while (temp_attack != 0) ...

Let's say in this position:

      __ __ __ __ BK __ __ __
      __ __ __ __ BR __ __ __
      __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __
      __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __
      __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __
      __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __
      __ __ __ __ WR __ __ __
      __ __ __ __ WK __ __ __

Here both rooks are pinning each other.
The white rook bitboard looks like this:

    tempBitboard = bitboard_array[WR];
    0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
    0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
    0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
    0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
    0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
    0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
    0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0
    0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0

The rook moves will look like this:

    rook_attacks = GetRookAttackFast(rook_square, COMBINED_OCCUPANCIES);
    0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
    0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0
    0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0
    0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0
    0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0
    0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0
    1  1  1  1  0  1  1  1
    0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0

We AND this with empty squares to get non capture moves:

    EMPTY_OCCUPANCIES:
    1  1  1  1  0  1  1  1
    1  1  1  1  0  1  1  1
    1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1
    1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1
    1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1
    1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1
    1  1  1  1  0  1  1  1
    1  1  1  1  0  1  1  1

    unsigned long long non_capture_moves = EMPTY_OCCUPANCIES & rook_attacks;
    non_capture_moves:
    0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
    0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
    0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0
    0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0
    0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0
    0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0
    1  1  1  1  0  1  1  1
    0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0

We get the capture moves by ANDing the attacks with black occupancies:

    BLACK_OCCUPANCIES:
    0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0
    0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0
    0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
    0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
    0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
    0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
    0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
    0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0

    unsigned long long capture_moves = BLACK_OCCUPANCIES & rook_attacks;
    capture_moves:
    0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
    0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0
    0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
    0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
    0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
    0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
    0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
    0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0

The pin bitboard will look like this:

    0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
    0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0
    0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0
    0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0
    0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0
    0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0
    0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
    0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0

We then AND that with captures and non captures. So if there is a pin, only these squares are valid.
Similar with check:

      __ __ __ __ BK __ __ __
      __ __ __ __ BR __ __ __
      __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __
      __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __
      __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __
      __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __
      WR __ __ __ __ __ __ __
      __ __ __ __ WK __ __ __

The check bitboard here:

    0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
    0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0
    0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0
    0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0
    0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0

The white rook attacks:

    1  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
    1  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
    1  0  0  0  0  0  0  0

    0  1  1  1  1  1  1  1
    1  0  0  0  0  0  0  0

AND then together:

    unsigned long long valid_rook_moves = checkBitboard & rook_attacks;
    0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
    0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
    0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
    0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
    0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
    0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
    0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0
    0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0

Only these moves are valid. 

The lazy and slow way to do pins and check:

    for (int i = 0; i < move_count; ++i) {

        MakeMove(move_list[i]);
        if (isWhiteToMove)
        {
          if (is_attacked_by_black(white_king_position, COMBINED_OCCUPANCIES) == true) {
            UnmakeMove(move_list[i]);
            continue;
          }
        } else {
          if (is_attacked_by_white(black_king_position, COMBINED_OCCUPANCIES) == true) {
            UnmakeMove(move_list[i]);
            continue;
          }
        }

    }

__Finding Pieces__

I didn't write BitscanForward. It uses the DEBRUJN method to get "the least significant bit".
That means the first smallest bit you find. There is a very simple way to do this but it's slower:

  int BitScanForwardSlow(const unsigned long long bitboard)
  {
      if (bitboard == 0) { //no bits
          return -1;
      }
      for (size_t i = 0; i < 64; ++i) { //loop through the squares
          if ((bitboard & SQUARE_BBS[i]) != 0) { //We compare the bit for that square, != 0 means it is 1 in that square
              return i;
          }
      }
      return -1;
  }

The original looks like this:

  inline int BitScanForward(unsigned long long bitboard)
  {
    return (DEBRUIJN64[MAGIC * (bitboard ^ (bitboard - 1)) >> 58]);
  }

  const unsigned long long MAGIC = 0x03f79d71b4cb0a89;
  const int DEBRUIJN64[64] =
  {
    0, 47,  1, 56, 48, 27,  2, 60,
    57, 49, 41, 37, 28, 16,  3, 61,
    54, 58, 35, 52, 50, 42, 21, 44,
    38, 32, 29, 23, 17, 11,  4, 62,
    46, 55, 26, 59, 40, 36, 15, 53,
    34, 51, 20, 43, 31, 22, 10, 45,
    25, 39, 14, 33, 19, 30,  9, 24,
    13, 18,  8, 12,  7,  6,  5, 63
  };

I can't explain this algorithm to you. I just copied the code but it's faster
than looping the squares. There is an integer overflow in this algorithm when you multiply so it
will cause problems in some languages.

To remove the least significant bit we use this method:

    tempBitboard &= tempBitboard - 1;
